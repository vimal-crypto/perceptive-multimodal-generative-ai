## Papers

### PMG_AI.pdf
**Title:** Perceptive Multimodal Generative AI for Comic Generation and Style Transfer (PMG-1)

**Abstract:** This paper presents the first module of PMG-AI, focusing on:
- Comic generation using Stable Diffusion and GPT-based persona systems
- Advanced style transfer techniques using VGG19, GANs, and AdaIN
- Text extraction from images using OCR models
- Integration of deep learning and NLP for creative content generation

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel approach to persona-driven comic generation
- Multi-style transfer framework for artistic image transformation
- Efficient text extraction pipeline for multimodal processing

### PMG_AI_2.pdf
**Title:** Perceptive Multimodal Generative AI for Text-to-Image Synthesis and 3D Reconstruction (PMG-2)

**Abstract:** This paper presents the second module of PMG-AI, focusing on:
- Text-to-image synthesis using CLIP and latent diffusion models
- Animation generation for dynamic content creation
- Image inpainting for content completion
- 2D-to-3D reconstruction using depth estimation and mesh generation

**Key Contributions:**
- Advanced text-to-image pipeline with CLIP encoding and VQGAN decoding
- Novel 2D-to-3D reconstruction framework using MiDaS and point cloud processing
- Integrated system for multimodal content generation and transformation
